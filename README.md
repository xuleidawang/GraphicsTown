This is the final project of class Computer Graphics from UW-Madison.
It start with a framework has some basic features:
It keeps a list of objects that make up the “world”
It has a notion of time for animation, and the ability to “stop time”. Animation time is not connected to “Time of Day.”
It has a notion of “Time of Day” which is mainly used for positioning the sun direction. Creative students have found more things to do with this.
It has two different interfaces for controlling the viewpoint: an “ArcBall” that lets you look at the world from outside (and spin it around – as if it was a snow-globe), and a driving interface that let’s you drive around on the ground. We might add a third “flying” interface.
It has a mode where you can examine a specific object (it shows only that one object, and puts it in the center of the view)

Trees has the specular shading
Ground has the advanced texture
Works on chrome
